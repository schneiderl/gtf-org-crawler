# gtf-org-crawler
This is a Python tool to check for misspelled words in repositories under a organization or user.
It does this by looking for words from a list of common misspellings. The dictionary it uses to do this is based
on the list of common misspellings that can be found [here](https://github.com/schneiderl/misspellings-dict/blob/master/en).

# how to run it
To try it out, do the following: 

 ```python crawler.py OrganizationName ```
